"""
Echoflow CLI

This module provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing Echoflow credentials and configurations.
You can use this CLI to generate, load, and manage credential blocks stored in the `credentials.ini` file.

Usage:
- To load credentials and create credential blocks:
  echoflow load-credentials [--sync]
- To initialize an empty `credentials.ini` file:
  echoflow init

Subcommands:
- `load-credentials`: Load credentials from the `.ini` file and create corresponding credential blocks.
  Options:
  --sync: If provided, syncs blocks updated using the Prefect UI.

- `init`: Initializes an empty `.ini` file for Echoflow credentials configuration.

Example:
- Load credentials and sync blocks:
  echoflow load-credentials --sync

- Initialize an empty `.ini` file:
  echoflow init

Note:
- Use the appropriate subcommand to perform desired actions related to Echoflow credentials.
- When using `load-credentials`, ensure that the `credentials.ini` file is correctly formatted with appropriate sections and keys.
- Supported section names are "AWS" and "AZCosmos".

    Retrieves the path to the Echoflow rules text file.

    This function constructs the path to the 'echoflow_rules.txt' file located within
    a '.echoflow' directory in the user's home directory. The function assumes that
    the '.echoflow' directory is already present in the user's home directory. If the
    directory does not exist, this function will still return the constructed path,
    but accessing the file may result in an error if further action is not taken
    to either create the directory or place the 'echoflow_rules.txt' file in the expected
    location.

    Returns:

    Cleans the existing ruleset file and repopulates it with a given set of rules.

    This function first deletes the current 'echoflow_rules.txt' file located within
    the '.echoflow' directory in the user's home directory. It then creates a new
    'echoflow_rules.txt' file and populates it with the rules provided in the input set.
    The function performs a sanity check on each rule to ensure it follows the expected 
    format "parent_flow:child_flow". If any rule does not comply, a ValueError is raised,
    and the operation is aborted. 

    Parameters:
        rules (set): A set of strings, each representing a rule in the format
                     "parent_flow:child_flow". This set of rules will replace any
                     existing rules in the 'echoflow_rules.txt' file.

    Returns:
        set: The same set of rules provided as input, indicating the rules now
             present in the 'echoflow_rules.txt' file.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any rule in the input set does not contain a colon (':'),
                    indicating it does not follow the "parent_flow:child_flow" format.

    Side effects:
        - The existing 'echoflow_rules.txt' file is deleted, and its contents are lost.
        - A new 'echoflow_rules.txt' file is created with the contents set to the input rules.
        - If the input rules contain any format errors, the entire operation is aborted,
          and the 'echoflow_rules.txt' file remains deleted.

    Notes:
        - This function relies on `fetch_ruleset` to determine the path to the rules file and
          `add_rules_from_set` to repopulate the new rules file. It is assumed that both

    Generate the credentials.ini file and configuration files for Echoflow.

    if it doesn't exist already. It then generates the `credentials.ini` file within
    this directory, which serves as the configuration file for Echoflow credentials.

    Additionally, the function configures pre-defined rules by generating an `echoflow_rules.txt`
    file containing rule definitions that dictate the workflow execution sequence in Echoflow.

    Example:
        Calling this function will create a `.echoflow` directory in the user's home
        directory and generate the `credentials.ini` and `echoflow_rules.txt` files within it.
        The credentials.ini file holds Echoflow configuration details, while the echoflow_rules.txt
        file defines the workflow execution sequence.

    Rules Format:
        The `echoflow_rules.txt` file contains lines with rule definitions. Each rule specifies
        the execution sequence of two workflow components, separated by a colon. For example:
        "echoflow_open_raw:echoflow_compute_SV" means `echoflow_open_raw` should be executed
        before `echoflow_compute_SV`.

      Arguments:
        - `stage_name`: Name of the stage for which to generate boilerplate code.
    
    - `rules`: View, add, or import flow rules from a file.
      Options:
        --add: Add a new rule interactively. Requires input in `parent_flow:child_flow` format.
        --add-from-file: Path to a file containing rules to be added. Each rule should be on a new line in `parent_flow:child_flow` format.
