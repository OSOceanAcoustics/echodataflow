"""
Echoflow Credentials Configuration

This script provides functionality to generate the `credentials.ini` file for
configuring credentials in Echoflow. The `credentials.ini` file serves as the
configuration file for securely storing and accessing cloud credentials.

The script creates a directory named `.echoflow` in the user's home directory,
if it doesn't already exist. It then generates the `credentials.ini` file within
this directory, allowing users to populate it with their cloud credentials.

Usage:
    Execute this script to generate the `credentials.ini` file within the
    `.echoflow` directory in the user's home directory. This file can be further
    edited to store cloud credentials securely for use in Echoflow pipelines.
