# Pipeline Configuration
In this section, we will provide you with the pipeline configuration that we'll be using for our target strength processing. The configuration is presented in YAML format, which is a structured and human-readable way to define settings for data processing.

Here's the configuration we'll be using:

```yaml
active_recipe: target_strength 
use_local_dask: true
n_workers: 5
pipeline:
- recipe_name: target_strength
  stages:
  - name: echodataflow_open_raw
    module: echodataflow.stages.subflows.open_raw
    options:
      save_raw_file: true
      use_raw_offline: true
      use_offline: true
  - name: echodataflow_compute_TS
    module: echodataflow.stages.subflows.compute_TS
    options:
      use_offline: true
```

<!-- Let's break down the components of this configuration:

- **active_recipe**: Specifies the recipe to be used for processing, which is set as "target_strength" in this case.

- **use_local_dask**: This flag indicates that we'll be utilizing a local Dask Cluster for parallel processing.

- **n_workers**: Determines the number of worker processes in the Dask Cluster. Here, we're using 5 workers for efficient parallelization.

- **pipeline**: This section defines the sequence of stages to execute. In this example, we're following the "target_strength" recipe, which comprises two stages.

- **echodataflow_open_raw**: This stage utilizes the `open_raw` subflow module to open raw data files. It includes options such as saving raw files, using raw data in offline mode, and utilizing offline data.

- **echodataflow_compute_TS**: This stage employs the `compute_TS` subflow module to compute target strength. It includes an option to use offline data. -->

**Note**: For a more comprehensive understanding of each option and its functionality, you can refer to the [Pipeline documentation](../configuration/pipeline.md).

Keep in mind that in this example, we'll be setting up a local Dask Cluster with 5 workers for parallel processing. This configuration will enable us to efficiently process our data for target strength analysis. To turn it off, toggle `use_local_dask` to false.

Feel free to explore and modify the configuration to understand better.
